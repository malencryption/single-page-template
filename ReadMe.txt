Sweet and Succulent Plant Shop

You have been tasked with updating a client's site for their spring plant sale! Someone already tried to make some updates and messed up a few things on the site. That's where you come in! Fix the typos and make the updates as specified.

-- BEGINNER --

SELECT NEXT MATCH
The CSS Links in the head element all have a typo in the href attribute name. 
* Select the first one, then use your shortcut to select the next match, 4 times, then type in the correction.
* Make sure to use your escape key or click somewhere else to go back to having just one cursor.

CLICK AND DRAG TO MOVE
* Move the logo image before the logo text. ( Keep both inside the #logo-container)

MULTIPLE CURSORS
All the items in the menu are missing closing li tags!
* Use your shortcuts to add a cursor to the end of each line, after the closing </a> for each link. Type the closing </li> tag for each, at the same time.  

COPY & PASTE
* Find the Mobile Menu (search for nav-mobile). Currently only the shop link is there. Copy the other two navigation links from the menu and add them here.

CUT & PASTE
The owner wants the section with "We're Local" to be first. 
* Cut the section with "Bringing the Sunshine" out and paste it below the section "We're Local"

FIND AND REPLACE
Change all the Product Titles to use a level 5 heading (h5) rather than a level 4 heading.
* Select the #shop div, use your shortcut to open the find and replace bar, and toggle on the "Find In Selection" Option.
* Change all instances of "h4" to "h5"

The owner wants to have online customers call to reserve plants, rather than adding them to their shopping cart.
* Change all the button text on the shop products, from "Add to Cart" to "Call To Reserve"

DUPLICATE SELECTION
* Find the Quick links in the footer. Selection the li with the "About" link, and duplicate this line two times below this. Update these links to match the other two menu items. 

* Similarly, find the li with the "YouTube" link in the "connect" area of the footer. Duplicate this line three times above it. Update these links to be for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. (The href can be left alone, just change the text that will display)

TOGGLE COMMENTS
* Find the two .parallax divs that are commented out, use your shortcut to uncomment them!

YOUR CHOICE
Use your choice of shortcuts to make the following updates to the products and prices.
* Make the products mobile friendly by replacing the class "s3" in the wrapping div for each product. Replace it with (s12 m6 l4 xl3)
* Reorganize the products to match the order in the list
* Add the Sale Prices right after the "span" with class "price". Use a span with class "sale-price" <span class="sale-price">$5</span>
* Add the class "inactive" to each "span" with class "price". 
* Use the following list:

Mini
Regular Price: $5
Sale Price: $3

Regular Cacti
Regular Price: $12
Sale Price: $9

Medium Cacti
Regular Price: $9
Sale Price: $7
